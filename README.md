# Project 5 - Angular 2 App

A mobile-first web app for colonists on Mars to report alien sightings.

## Tools Used

* Angular 2
* Angular 2 CLI
* SASS
* Fluid Typography
* WP REST API v2

## Reflections

I enjoyed working with Angular2, especially the ways it allows an app to interact with a JSON API. I pulled in data from 2 APIs for this project, one for all the data and a WP API for the Colony Blog.

I made a small attempt at trying out Fluid Typography. It's an intriguing concept that I'd like to try out in a more text-heavy situation. 

I would like to figure out a way to provide feedback to the users about not having form fields completed.
